# Elec-Imp-Remote
Project to control [Elec-Imp-Relay](https://github.com/dwaq/Elec-Imp-Relay) from [32F429IDISCOVERY board](http://www.st.com/web/catalog/tools/FM116/SC959/SS1532/LN1848/PF259090)

This code is a work in progress.

This uses the LCD to display information. I plan on using an ESP8266 module to connect to Wi-Fi. I also thinking of using the MEMS sensor on the evaluation board for some extra functionality.

Built on top of the Touch_Panel example project from http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/PF259429 The majority of that code is copywritten to prohibit from sharing, so I can only share my own file. Down the road, I can write instructions on how to compile it using Keil uVision and ST's library files.
